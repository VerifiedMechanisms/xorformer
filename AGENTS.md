Conventions for writing theorem / writeup markdown in this repo so that it renders cleanly in GitHub, VS Code preview, and Obsidian.

## Math

Use LaTeX math delimiters, not backticks.

- **Inline math:** wrap in single dollar signs, e.g. `$f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$`.
- **Display math:** wrap in double dollar signs on their own lines, with a blank line before and after.

  ```markdown
  Some lead-in text.

  $$
  z(a,b) = \frac{N(a,b)}{D(a,b)}
  $$

  Continuation text.
  ```

- Use `\{`, `\}` for set braces, `\to` for arrows, `\neq`, `\geq`, `\leq`, `\in`, `\cdot`, `\top` (for transpose), `\blacksquare` for Q.E.D.
- Multi-line derivations use `\begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned}` inside a `$$` block, with `&=` alignment.
- Group short related equations with `\qquad` spacing on one display line rather than stacking many tiny blocks.
- Never use plain ASCII like `!=`, `>=`, `^T`, `sum`, `alpha` in math; always use the LaTeX command.
- Never wrap math in backticks. Backticks are reserved for code identifiers and file paths.

## Structure

- `#` for the theorem title, `##` for top-level sections (`Statement`, `Proof`, `Consequence`, etc.).
- Sub-theorems inside a proof use `###` with a period-separated title like `### Theorem 2. Antipode identities`. Never put an em dash in a heading.
- Inline mini-proofs use **bold run-in headers**: `**Proof.**`, `**Reason.**`, `**Claim.**`.
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for informal restatements or remarks that sit alongside the formal statement.
- Use ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, ...) for enumerated cases and unordered lists (`-`) for bullet points.

## Prose

- No em dashes anywhere (user global rule). Use `,`, `;`, `:`, or `.` instead. No exceptions for headings, captions, or run-in labels.
- Italicize short emphases with `*...*`; bold with `**...**` for labels and run-in headers.
- Keep paragraphs short. Blank line between paragraphs, between display math and prose, and between list items that contain display math.

## Code and identifiers

- Use backticks only for: file names, directory paths, Lean identifiers, shell commands, and literal code snippets.
- Do **not** use backticks for mathematical variables or expressions. Those go in `$...$`.

## Example skeleton

```markdown
# Theorem Title

## Statement

Let $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$. Suppose ...

$$
\text{main equation}
$$

> **Equivalently.** Informal restatement.

## Proof

Prose lead-in.

### Theorem 1. Short name

**Claim.** Something.

**Proof.** Expand:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &= Y + Z \\
  &= W.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Conclusion

Wrap up. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

$$
H^{*}(f) \geq 2.
$$
```

Apply this style to every file under `theorems/` and to `writeup.md`.
