# Shared Projection Boolean Closure

## Statement

Let

$$ t(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_i x_i, \qquad \lambda_i>0, $$

and write its image in increasing order as

$$ \tau_0<\tau_1<\cdots<\tau_{M-1}. $$

Suppose Boolean functions $f_1,\ldots,f_m$ all factor through this same statistic:

$$ f_j(x)=F_j(t(x)), \qquad F_j:\mathrm{Im}(t)\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace. $$

Let

$$ G:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^m\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace $$

be any Boolean operation, and define

$$ g(x):=G(f_1(x),\ldots,f_m(x)). $$

Then

$$ H^{\ast}(g) \leq C_t(g) \leq \sum_{j=1}^{m}C_t(f_j), $$

where $C_t(h)$ denotes the number of sign changes of $h$ along the ordered image of $t$.

In particular,

$$ H^{\ast}(g)\leq M-1. $$

> **Interpretation.** Once several functions are functions of the same positive weighted sum, arbitrary Boolean combinations stay in the same one-dimensional world. The cost is controlled by the number of new label changes along that shared statistic, not by recomputing the inputs separately.

## Proof

Define

$$ G_t(\tau):=G(F_1(\tau),\ldots,F_m(\tau)) $$

for $\tau\in\mathrm{Im}(t)$. Then

$$ g(x)=G_t(t(x)), $$

so $g$ also factors through $t$.

By the positive-projection sign-change theorem [013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md),

$$ H^{\ast}(g)\leq C_t(g). $$

It remains to compare sign-change counts. If $G_t$ changes between adjacent levels $\tau&#95;{\ell-1}$ and $\tau&#95;{\ell}$, then the vector

$$ \bigl(F_1(\tau),\ldots,F_m(\tau)\bigr) $$

must change between those two levels. Therefore at least one of the component functions $F_j$ changes between $\tau&#95;{\ell-1}$ and $\tau&#95;{\ell}$.

Thus the set of adjacent cuts where $G_t$ changes is contained in the union of the adjacent cuts where some $F_j$ changes. Hence

$$ C_t(g) \leq \sum_{j=1}^{m}C_t(f_j). $$

Since there are only $M$ projection levels, every label sequence has at most $M-1$ sign changes, so

$$ H^{\ast}(g)\leq C_t(g)\leq M-1. $$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequence

For two functions $f$ and $g$ sharing the same statistic $t$,

$$ H^{\ast}(f\wedge g), \quad H^{\ast}(f\vee g), \quad H^{\ast}(f\oplus g) \leq C_t(f)+C_t(g). $$

This explains why Boolean combinations of co-statistical functions should not be treated by a generic sum-of-heads construction. The shared statistic already supplies the basis.
