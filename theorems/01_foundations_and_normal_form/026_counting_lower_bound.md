# Counting Lower Bound For Worst-Case Head Complexity

## Statement

Let

$$ W(n) := \max_{f : \lbrace0,1\rbrace^n \to \lbrace0,1\rbrace} H^{\ast}(f). $$

Then

$$ W(n) = \Omega \left(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\right). $$

More quantitatively, for fixed $n$ and $H$, the number of $n$-bit Boolean functions computable with at most $H$ heads is at most

$$ 2^{O(n^2H)} $$

whenever $1 \leq H \leq 2^n$. Hence, if

$$ H = o \left(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\right), $$

then the fraction of $n$-bit Boolean functions computable with at most $H$ heads tends to $0$ as $n \to \infty$.

> **Interpretation.** Almost all Boolean functions require exponentially many heads, up to the polynomial slack in this counting argument. Thus no polynomial head bound can hold for all functions.

## Proof

We count sign patterns produced by the linear-fractional normal form.

### Lemma 1. An H-head score is controlled by few polynomial inequalities

Every $H$-head score is a special case of

$$ S(x) = c+\sum_{h=1}^{H}\frac{A_h(x)}{B_h(x)}, $$

where

$$ A_h(x)=a_{h,0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{h,i}x_i, \qquad B_h(x)=b_{h,0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{h,i}x_i, $$

and $B_h(x)>0$ on the cube. This is a slight relaxation of the exact atom form from [010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md](010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md), so counting this larger family can only increase the number of possible Boolean functions.

The relaxed family has

$$ p := 1+2H(n+1) $$

real parameters: one constant $c$, the affine numerator coefficients, and the affine denominator coefficients.

For each cube point $x\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n$, clear denominators and define

$$ P_x(\theta) := c\prod_{h=1}^{H}B_h(x) + \sum_{h=1}^{H}A_h(x)\prod_{j\neq h}B_j(x), $$

where $\theta$ denotes all $p$ real parameters. For each fixed $x$, this is a polynomial in $\theta$ of degree at most $H+1$.

If the score computes a Boolean function using a non-strict negative side, perturb the folded constant in the score slightly downward. Since the cube is finite and every positive input has strictly positive score, this gives an equivalent representation whose cleared values are strictly positive on positive inputs and strictly negative on negative inputs.

Thus every Boolean function computable with $H$ heads gives a strict sign pattern of the $2^n$ polynomials

$$ \lbrace P_x : x\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n\rbrace $$

in $p$ real variables, each of degree at most $H+1$. $\blacksquare$

### Lemma 2. Warren's sign-pattern bound

We use the following standard form of Warren's theorem. If $N$ real polynomials of degree at most $d$ in $p$ variables are evaluated over $\mathbb{R}^p$, and $N\geq p$, then the number of strict sign patterns they realize is at most

$$ \left(\frac{4edN}{p}\right)^p. $$

Apply this with

$$ N=2^n, \qquad d=H+1, \qquad p=1+2H(n+1). $$

When $N\geq p$, Lemma 1 gives

$$ \lvert\lbrace f : H^{\ast}(f)\leq H\rbrace\rvert \leq \left( \frac{4e(H+1)2^n}{1+2H(n+1)} \right)^{1+2H(n+1)}. $$

When $N<p$, the trivial bound $2^N$ is enough for the asymptotic conclusion below, because $p>N$ already implies

$$ H > \frac{2^n-1}{2(n+1)}. $$

### Lemma 3. The number of H-head functions is small for small H

Assume first that $1\leq H\leq 2^n$ and $N\geq p$. Since $p=O(nH)$ and $d=H+1\leq 2^{n}+1$, the logarithm of the Warren factor is $O(n)$. Therefore

$$ \log_2 \lvert\lbrace f : H^{\ast}(f)\leq H\rbrace\rvert \leq O(n^2H). $$

Equivalently,

$$ \lvert\lbrace f : H^{\ast}(f)\leq H\rbrace\rvert \leq 2^{O(n^2H)}. $$

If $N<p$, then $H=\Omega(2^n/n)$, so the trivial bound $2^{2^n}$ is also at most $2^{O(n^2H)}$. Hence the same estimate holds for every $1\leq H\leq 2^n$.

There are

$$ 2^{2^n} $$

Boolean functions on $\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n$. If

$$ H=o \left(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\right), $$

then

$$ 2^{O(n^2H)} = 2^{o(2^n)} $$

is a vanishing fraction of all Boolean functions. More explicitly, for some absolute constant $c>0$, the fraction of $n$-bit Boolean functions with

$$ H^{\ast}(f) \leq c\frac{2^n}{n^2} $$

is at most $2^{-\Omega(2^n)}$. Thus almost every $n$-bit Boolean function requires $\Omega(2^n/n^2)$ heads.

In particular, the worst-case quantity satisfies

$$ W(n)=\Omega \left(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\right). $$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequence

The general worst-case head complexity is now bracketed as

$$ \Omega \left(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\right) \leq W(n) \leq 2^n-1, $$

where the upper bound is the positive weighted-sum interpolation bound from [009_weighted_sum_upper_bound.md](009_weighted_sum_upper_bound.md).

For the finite range $3\leq n\leq 12$, the compact determinant certificates improve the upper side to

$$ W(n) \leq \left\lceil \frac{2^n-1}{n} \right\rceil. $$

This counting lemma does not identify the exact invariant $H^{\ast}(f)$. It shows that any exact invariant must be able to take exponentially large values on typical Boolean functions.
