# Raw Calibration Threshold-Degree Lower Bound

## Statement

Let

$$ T_1,\ldots,T_s:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace $$

be Boolean features, and suppose

$$ f(x)=1 \qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad c_0+\sum_{j=1}^{s}c_jT_j(x)>0 $$

with positive margin on the Boolean cube. Then

$$ \deg_{\pm}(f) \leq \sum_{j:c_j\neq0}\rho(T_j). $$

In particular, if

$$ f(x)=T_1(x)\wedge T_2(x), $$

then

$$ \rho(T_1)+\rho(T_2) \geq \deg_{\pm}(f), $$

and hence

$$ \max\lbrace\rho(T_1),\rho(T_2)\rbrace \geq \frac{\deg_{\pm}(f)}{2}. $$

> **Interpretation.** High threshold degree of a strict vote proves that its inner features cannot all have small raw calibration cost. This turns threshold-degree lower bounds into lower bounds on $\rho$ for at least one feature in the vote.

## Proof

The raw-calibrated vote support bound [093_raw_calibrated_vote_support_bound.md](093_raw_calibrated_vote_support_bound.md) gives

$$ H^{\ast}(f) \leq \sum_{j:c_j\neq0}\rho(T_j). $$

The threshold-degree lower bound [006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md) gives

$$ \deg_{\pm}(f)\leq H^{\ast}(f). $$

Combining the two inequalities proves

$$ \deg_{\pm}(f) \leq \sum_{j:c_j\neq0}\rho(T_j). $$

For conjunction, use the strict vote

$$ T_1(x)\wedge T_2(x)=1 \qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad T_1(x)+T_2(x)-\frac{3}{2}>0. $$

This vote has margin $1/2$. Applying the first part gives

$$ \deg_{\pm}(T_1\wedge T_2) \leq \rho(T_1)+\rho(T_2). $$

The maximum bound follows from

$$ \rho(T_1)+\rho(T_2) \leq 2\max\lbrace\rho(T_1),\rho(T_2)\rbrace. $$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

Sherstov's linear threshold-degree lower bounds for intersections of two halfspaces imply that some halfspaces have large raw calibration cost $\rho$. Otherwise the conjunction of two arbitrary halfspaces would have small $H^{\ast}$ by Lemma 93, contradicting the threshold-degree lower bound.

This is why the surviving decision-list target after Lemma 94 is not a bound depending only on length. The target is to classify low $\rho$ test families and to prove $\rho$ lower bounds for hard internal tests.
